# Plan

**Task**: Veridia Comic Book - 2 Stories in Aeon Flux-style Universe
**Status**: 🟡 IN PROGRESS

## Approach

Create two distinct, mind-bending comic stories set in the Panopticon of Veridia universe. Each story will subvert expectations, explore philosophical themes through action rather than exposition, and leverage the visual medium for reveals. Iterate on each story through self-critique cycles until achieving A+ quality.

- [ ] Create art style guide with reference prompts

Theme: Identity and memory - what makes you "you" if your memories can be copied?

- [ ] Story concept and twist design
- [ ] Beat sheet / outline
- [ ] Full panel script (14 pages, ~70 panels)
- [ ] Image generation prompts for each panel
- [ ] Self-critique v1
- [ ] Revision cycle until A-grade minimum

### Phase 4: Story 2 Development - "Symbiont's Gambit"
Theme: Free will vs determinism - is choosing rebellion still control?

- [ ] Story concept and twist design
- [ ] Beat sheet / outline
- [ ] Full panel script (14 pages, ~70 panels)
- [ ] Image generation prompts for each panel
- [ ] Self-critique v1
- [ ] Revision cycle until A-grade minimum

### Phase 5: Polish & Integration
- [ ] Name originality verification
- [ ] Consistency check across both stories
- [ ] Final critique for A+ validation
- [ ] Compile complete comic book document

### Phase 6: Verification
- [ ] Run /verify for independent assessment
- [ ] Address any gaps

## Story Concepts (Draft)

### Story 1: "The Curator's Eye"
**Protagonist**: Selen Vareth - An archivist in Veridia's Memory Vault who catalogs citizens' backup memories
**Hook**: She discovers her own memory backup shows her living a completely different life
**Twist 1**: The "other" Selen is hunting her
**Twist 2**: She IS the copy - the original wanted to escape Veridia and needed a distraction
**Theme**: You are not your memories; you are your choices
**Ending**: She lets the original escape, choosing to become someone new rather than reclaim the old self

### Story 2: "Symbiont's Gambit"
**Protagonist**: Castor Venn - A border guard who's been implanted with a symbiotic creature from the Ex-Zone
**Hook**: The symbiont gives him visions of the future, making him invaluable to Veridia
**Twist 1**: The visions are actually the symbiont's memories of a previous Loop cycle
**Twist 2**: Veridia has been using symbionts to perpetuate the Loop - his "rebellion" is scripted
**Theme**: True freedom might mean accepting uncertainty rather than seeking control
**Ending**: He chooses to act randomly, breaking the deterministic cycle, accepting he might fail

## Checkpoints

1. After each story outline: Does the twist work? Is it earned?
2. After each full script: Does pacing serve the story? Are silent beats used effectively?
3. After each critique: What specific improvements needed?
4. Before verification: Do both stories hit ALL criteria?
