# Project Goals

**Project**: task-20251211-220516 - Veridia Comic Book
**Created**: 2025-12-11 22:05
**Task Type**: Creative Writing / Comic Book Production

## Original Request
> Comic book with 2 different stories exploring an Aeon Flux style Universe (animated series, not movie). Surrealist bio-punk and psychological. Each story must have plot twists/mind games, be individually compelling, have crisp satisfying endings, thought-provoking takeaways without being preachy. KDP publishing standards. Iterate until A+ grade.

## Universe: The Panopticon of Veridia
- **Veridia**: Sterile walled utopia, white towers, surveillance, genetically perfected but emotionally suppressed citizens
- **Ex-Zone**: Chaotic mutagenic jungle outside walls, dissidents and failed experiments
- **The Border**: Fortified clash zone
- **Bio-Tech**: Somatic hacking (detachable limbs, eye swaps, blood-stored data), The Loop (generational reset rumor)
- **Aesthetic**: Brutalist architecture + grotesque biological tech, flesh/insect devices, avant-garde fashion
- **Conflict**: Order (Veridia) vs Entropy (Ex-Zone)
- **Tone**: Cold, detached, intellectual yet visceral and violent

## Iteration Triggers
- "iterate until A+ grade" → Multiple revision cycles with rigorous critique
- "critiqued and evaluated in a loop" → Each story needs multiple passes
- "comprehensive" style references → Must deeply embody Aeon Flux/VanderMeer/PKD aesthetics

## Scope
- **In scope**:
  - 2 complete comic stories with panel-by-panel scripts
  - Image generation prompts for each panel
  - Art style guide with reference prompts
  - KDP-compliant formatting specifications
  - Unique character/location names (no existing IP copies)

- **Out of scope**:
  - Actual image generation (deferred to later)
  - Final print-ready files
  - Full book layout/typesetting

## Success Criteria
1. **Two distinct, compelling stories** - Different themes, protagonists, and plot structures
2. **Mind-bending plot twists** - Each story has at least 2 genuine surprises that recontextualize earlier events
3. **Satisfying endings** - Conclusions feel earned, not arbitrary; thematic resonance
4. **Thought-provoking messages** - Philosophical depth without lecturing
5. **Visual storytelling** - Panel descriptions leverage the medium (silent beats, visual reveals, page-turn surprises)
6. **Authentic aesthetic** - Captures Aeon Flux surrealism: impossible architecture, body horror beauty, fashion-forward violence
7. **KDP compliance** - Proper page counts, panel layouts, trim sizes documented
8. **Unique naming** - All names original, not borrowed from existing works
9. **Production-ready prompts** - Image generation prompts specific enough for consistent style

## Quality Bar
- **Minimum acceptable**: Stories are coherent with basic twists, prompts are usable
- **Target**: Stories are genuinely surprising and memorable, prompts produce consistent style
- **Excellent (A+)**: Stories would hold up alongside professional indie comics; twists are "I need to re-read that" quality; themes linger after reading

## Model Configuration
- **default_model**: claude (direct generation)
- **verification_model**: claude
