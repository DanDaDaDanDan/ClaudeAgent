## PAGE 1: THE HELIX VAULT

### Panel 1 (Wide establishing shot - top third of page)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, 1990s MTV animation aesthetic, bio-punk surrealism,
elongated angular anatomy, comic book panel art, clean line work with cel shading,
dramatic architectural establishing shot,

The Helix Vault - a massive double-helix structure of white concrete and chrome,
spiraling into a pale sterile sky that has no visible sun,
surveillance drones circling like black insects,
IMPOSSIBLE GEOMETRY - the helix appears to spiral in both directions simultaneously,
brutalist bio-punk architecture, citizens as small elongated figures below,
the building's windows are arranged like vertebrae on a spine,

Camera: extreme wide shot, low angle looking up at the structure
Composition: helix structure dominating center, perspective deliberately wrong
Lighting: flat diffused daylight with no source, clinical brightness, no shadows anywhere
```

**CAPTION (top left)**: "Veridia. The city of perfect memory."

**CAPTION (bottom right)**: "Here, death is bureaucracy. Identity is data. And forgetting is the only true crime."

### Panel 2 (Interior - wide horizontal panel)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, bio-punk surrealism, comic panel art,
sterile white brutalist interior, geometric impossible architecture,
elongated human figures,

Interior of the Helix Vault - endless rows of memory pods stretching into infinity,
each pod containing a sleeping human backup, pale bodies visible through frosted glass,
organic data cables connecting pods to central spine like an enormous nervous system,
surveillance EYES embedded in the ceiling - actual organic eyes, blinking,
the corridor's perspective is subtly WRONG - it seems longer when you look directly at it,
bodies stored like files, beautiful and clinical,

Camera: wide interior shot, one-point perspective that subtly curves
Composition: vanishing point in center, pods creating leading lines
Lighting: cold fluorescent from above, soft glow from pods, eyes reflecting light
```

**CAPTION**: "The Helix Vault. Where every citizen's soul is backed up."

### Panel 3 (Medium shot - ESTABLISHING CHARACTER REBELLION)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, elongated angular anatomy, bio-punk surrealism,
sterile white brutalist interior, floating holographic elements,

SELEN VARETH - impossibly tall angular woman with geometric black bob haircut,
porcelain pale skin with faint circuitry-trace birthmarks flowing down her neck like rivers,
wearing white asymmetrical archivist coat with exposed spine panel AND one small deviation:
a VIOLET thread woven into her collar - the smallest rebellion, fashion as whispered dissent,
sitting at an organic workstation, surrounded by floating holographic memory fragments,
but she's ALSO secretly accessing a hidden file - poetry, her own poetry,
stored in the archives where no one looks,
expression focused, double-tasking between duty and secret self,

Camera: medium shot, slight low angle emphasizing her height
Composition: Selen in left third, legitimate work right, secret file ghosted beneath
Lighting: hologram glow on her face, clinical ambient light
```

**CAPTION**: "I am Selen Vareth. Memory Curator, Third Spiral."

```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, close-up character portrait,
elongated features, large expressive almond eyes, high cheekbones, impossibly long neck,

Selen's hand touching a luminous memory orb, her face reflected in its surface,
BUT her reflection moves differently than she does - one beat behind, watching her,
circuitry birthmarks visible on her impossibly long fingers,
the reflection's expression is slightly harder, colder,
a hint that something is wrong,

Camera: close-up, focused on hand and reflection
Composition: hand in lower third, reflected face in upper portion of orb
Lighting: memory orb as primary light source, warm glow, reflection slightly darker
```

the corridor LENGTHENS as she walks - impossible architecture,
her violet thread catching the light,

Camera: long shot, high angle
Composition: Selen small in frame, architecture dominating and ACTIVE
Lighting: flat, shadowless, institutional
```

**CAPTION**: "But lately, I've wondered—what echoes in my own archive?"

### Panel 2 (Medium shot)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, holographic memory playback,
memory orb expanding into three-dimensional scene,
elongated figure watching,

Selen initiates playback of her backup memory - a ghostly recreation,
the scene shows HER but not a memory she recognizes,
beginning to manifest in the air before her like smoke becoming solid,
her impossibly long body leaning forward, curious,

Camera: medium wide, showing both Selen and the emerging memory
Composition: real Selen left, memory manifestation right
Lighting: ethereal blue glow from memory, contrast with clinical white
```

mutagenic vegetation, bioluminescent environment,
DIFFERENT COLOR PALETTE - greens, purples, amber warning,

MEMORY PLAYBACK: Shows Selen in the Ex-Zone, fighting mutated creatures,
her body in dynamic combat pose - limbs at impossible angles, hyperextended joints,
clothes torn, expression fierce and ALIVE in a way Curator-Selen has never been,
this is clearly NOT the Selen we've been following - battle-hardened, VIOLENT,
organic monstrosities surrounding her, bile green and bruise purple palette,
her movements are acrobatic, dancer-like, lethal,

Camera: dynamic diagonal angle
Composition: memory-Selen in center, combat chaos surrounding
Lighting: bioluminescent jungle glow, dramatic action lighting
```

**NO DIALOGUE** - Let the image shock

---

### Panel 4 (Close-up)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, emotional close-up,
expression of confusion and growing horror,
elongated features, impossibly large eyes,

Selen's face - our Selen, the curator - staring at the memory playback,
her eyes wide (taking up a third of her face), mouth slightly open,
recognition of self but not memory, cognitive dissonance visualized,
circuitry birthmarks seem to PULSE with her heartbeat,
her reflection in the hologram now matches her perfectly - the wrongness gone,
as if the wrong reflection was preparing her,

Camera: tight close-up on face
Composition: face fills frame, massive eyes as focal point
Lighting: blue memory glow reflected in her eyes
```

**SELEN (thought balloon)**: "This isn't... I've never been to the Ex-Zone."

### Panel 5 (Shock panel)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, violent memory,
memory playback showing murder,
elongated violent figure,

MEMORY PLAYBACK: Shows Selen - the memory version - killing a Veridia guard,
her elongated arm THROUGH his chest using a bio-blade that extends from her wrist,
her pose is editorial, fashion-spread violence, beautiful and terrible,
clinical violence, expression cold and necessary,
blood on white walls in artistic splatter, horrifying but composed,
she's posing even in murder, because that's who she was,

Camera: medium shot, frontal view of the violence
Composition: memory-Selen dominant, victim subordinate, posed like art
Lighting: harsh, clinical, blood appearing almost decorative
```

**SELEN (thought balloon)**: "I killed him. I don't remember killing anyone. I've never—"

## PAGE 3: DISSONANCE

### Panel 1 (Medium shot - SURREAL ELEMENT)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, psychological moment,
character examining self, existential dread,
impossible perspective,

Selen stops the playback abruptly, looks at her own hands,
hands trembling slightly, she turns them over examining them,
as if checking for blood that isn't there, birthmarks visible and MOVING,
the room around her has subtly SHIFTED - the angles are wrong now,
walls meeting at angles that aren't 90 degrees,

Camera: close on hands, face partially visible above
Composition: hands in center, face in upper portion, room WRONG around them
Lighting: clinical ambient, geometry casting impossible shadows
```

**SELEN (thought balloon)**: "These hands. My hands."

---

### Panel 2 (Screen panel)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, data interface,
holographic records, split-screen comparison,

Selen accessing deeper archives, childhood memories displayed,

Composition: Selen center, data screens surrounding
Lighting: multiple hologram glows
```

**CAPTION**: "Childhood—verified. Parents—verified. Academy training—verified."

---

### Panel 3 (Disturbing revelation)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, timeline visualization,
memory timeline with visible divergence point,
data horror,

Display showing timeline of memories - a clear SPLIT three months ago,
one branch shows her normal curator life, the other shows violence and Ex-Zone,
the fork looks like a WOUND in the data, organic edges around the split,
visual representation of forking identity, time bleeding,

Camera: close on the display
Composition: timeline spanning horizontally, fork point emphasized
Lighting: data glow, red highlighting on divergence point
```

**SELEN (thought balloon)**: "But three months ago... the timeline splits."

---

### Panel 4 (Interruption)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, workplace scene,
colleague approaching, Selen hiding her screen,
elongated figures,

A co-worker approaches - impossibly tall figure with elongated neck, pleasant but empty expression,
eyes too large, smile too wide, perfectly Veridia-conditioned,
Selen quickly minimizes her personal data, composing her face,
social mask going up, hiding her discovery,
her violet thread tucked beneath her collar now,

Camera: medium two-shot
Composition: co-worker approaching from right, Selen in left defensive position
Lighting: standard clinical ambient
```

**CO-WORKER**: "Curator Vareth. Your shift ended forty minutes ago."

---

### Panel 5 (Resolution panel)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, determined character,
night lighting, decision made,
elongated silhouette,

Selen alone again, the Vault quieter, her expression hardening into resolve,
she looks at the closed file, then at the vault stretching beyond,
decision visible in her elongated posture - she will investigate,
the room's geometry has returned to "normal" - but she noticed it was wrong,

Camera: medium shot, slight low angle
Composition: Selen in center, vault extending behind her
Lighting: dimmer night-cycle illumination
```

**SELEN (thought balloon)**: "I need to see the restricted archives. After lights-down."

**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, infiltration scene,
night lighting in sterile environment, shadows where there shouldn't be,
elongated stealthy figure,

Night shift - Selen sneaks through the Vault, emergency lighting only,
her white coat stands out, she moves between server columns,
her movement is ACROBATIC - low to ground, limbs extending at wrong angles,
surveillance eyes dimmed but not dormant, some twitching in sleep,
she flows like water around obstacles, dancer-assassin grace,

Camera: long shot, high angle
Composition: Selen threading between massive structures
Lighting: blue emergency lighting, pools of shadow

Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, surveillance horror,
screens activating, face appearing, eyes everywhere,
impossibly appearing face,

Alert triggered - every screen AND every surveillance eye activates simultaneously,
OVERSEER KRETH's face appears on screens, but also projected FROM the organic eyes,
androgynous features, elongated neck, silver-wire hair,
eyes replaced with surveillance implants that glow with data,
cold, inhuman beauty, speaking with authority,
the face is EVERYWHERE, surrounding Selen completely,

Camera: multiple angles on screens, Selen small between them

**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, running figure,
dynamic escape, elongated anatomy in motion,
fashion-forward flight,

Selen runs - her white coat streaming behind her like a wing,
she crashes through a doorway into transit corridors,
her run is ACROBATIC - part sprint, part dance, impossible strides,
surveillance eyes awakening behind her like a wave,
fashion-forward flight, fear and determination combined,
the violet thread on her collar flying free,

Camera: tracking shot from side, motion blur
Composition: diagonal movement left to right, door frame behind
Lighting: emergency red blending into transit corridor white
```

**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, technical action,
character using security systems, door sealing,
MEMORY SCAN avoiding,

Selen at a security panel, using archivist codes to seal a blast door,
BUT ALSO avoiding a MEMORY SCAN - a beam that would read her thoughts,
she ducks under the beam as she codes, acrobatic and precise,
the door made of living material, contracting like a sphincter,
drones impacting the closing door behind her,

Camera: medium shot, action focused
Composition: Selen dodging AND coding, scan beam visible
Lighting: security panel glow, memory scan blue, emergency amber
```

**SELEN**: "Override Vareth-7-7-Null. Seal section."

```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, breathing room,
character at public terminal, searching for information,
elongated hiding,

Brief safety - Selen at a public terminal in a transit hub,
citizens moving around her, she's trying to blend in,
her HEIGHT makes blending difficult - she's taller than most,
accessing her file on public network with limited success,
her violet thread hidden, coat smoothed, posture smaller,

Camera: medium shot, terminal prominent
Composition: Selen hunched over terminal, crowd flowing around
Lighting: public area lighting, terminal glow on face
```

```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, decision moment,
character looking toward horizon, determination,
impossible transit display,

Selen looking toward the transit hub displays showing routes,

her expression hardening, a plan forming despite being hunted,
her elongated fingers touching the violet thread like a talisman,

Camera: medium shot, displays in background
Composition: Selen's profile, destination displays behind (glitching)
Lighting: transit hub lighting, destination highlighted
```

```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, public transit,
sterile train interior, genetically perfect passengers,
EMOTIONAL SUPPRESSION atmosphere,

Selen on a transit train, hiding among worker-caste citizens,
trying to appear small, unremarkable, her curator coat hidden under a borrowed gray wrap,
other passengers are blank-faced, emotionally suppressed - the NORM,
they're all on mild suppressants, can't feel enough to question,
Selen has to MATCH their emptiness to blend,

Camera: medium wide shot of train interior
Composition: Selen in crowd, slightly distinct
Lighting: flat transit lighting, no shadows
```

**NO DIALOGUE** - Tension of hiding in plain sight

```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, social isolation,
passengers creating distance, pointed rejection,
elongated empty space,

Citizens around her subtly move away, creating a void,
no one makes eye contact, they know but won't report—yet,
the empty space around her is its own prison,
her elongated form suddenly visible, exposed,
the suppressants make them apathetic, but not blind,

Camera: medium shot, empty space surrounding Selen
Composition: Selen isolated in center, bodies at edges
Lighting: same flat light, but she's alone in it
```

**NO DIALOGUE** - The silence is the statement

**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, massive architecture,
Border Wall, defensive structure with organic intrusion,
IMPOSSIBLE SCALE AND GEOMETRY,

The Border Wall - massive Veridia fortification,
but the Ex-Zone is growing INTO it, organic tendrils, flesh-growths,
watchtowers with cancerous protrusions, searchlights cutting mist,
the Wall curves UPWARD beyond sight - as if surrounding a bowl,
soldiers in bio-mechanical armor patrolling, elongated in their suits,
from this angle, it's unclear if the Wall keeps things out or in,

Camera: extreme wide shot, low angle
Composition: wall dominating frame, Selen tiny below
Lighting: searchlights, bioluminescent growth, mist diffusion
```

**CAPTION**: "The Wall. Built to keep entropy out. Failing."

### Panel 4 (Escape route)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, escape moment,
finding weakness, organic breach,
hope in corruption,

Selen spots it - a section of wall where Ex-Zone growth has created a breach,
the organic matter has DISSOLVED the concrete, creating a passage,
it looks like a wound in reality, raw edges,
guards haven't noticed yet, busy with alarms,
the breach PULSES, almost inviting,

Camera: Selen's POV toward breach
Composition: breach visible in background, guards in mid-ground
Lighting: bioluminescent glow from breach, chaos around
```

**SELEN (thought balloon)**: "There. Where the wall is dying."

**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, pivotal moment,
character at threshold, leaving everything,
editorial pose in crisis,

SILENT PANEL - Selen pauses at the breach, looking back at Veridia,
the white towers visible in the distance, beautiful and terrible,
ahead is the unknown organic darkness, behind is death,
her pose is EDITORIAL - even in crisis, Aeon Flux style, fashion-model frozen,
her face unreadable, body poised on the edge,
the violet thread catching final Veridia light,

Camera: profile shot, both worlds visible
Composition: Selen in center, Veridia left, Ex-Zone right
Lighting: clinical white behind, organic glow ahead
```

### Panel 1 (Crossing)
**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, threshold crossing,
crawling through organic breach, transformation moment,
body horror beauty,

Selen crawling through the breach - the organic material wet and warm,
her white clothes becoming stained with bio-luminescent fluids,
the breach is TIGHT around her, intimate, almost digestive,
transition from sterility to organic chaos,
she emerges reborn, covered in glowing slime,

Camera: close, claustrophobic

**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, Ex-Zone establishing shot,
mutagenic jungle, hostile beauty, bioluminescent nightmare,
overwhelming OTHER,

The Ex-Zone revealed - overwhelming organic beauty and horror,
jungle of impossible plants that BREATHE, structures that pulse,
nothing is geometry here - everything is grown, alive, watching,
bile green and bruise purple, colors that shouldn't exist together,
the ground itself undulates slowly,
nothing is still, nothing is safe, but it's ALIVE in ways Veridia isn't,

Camera: wide shot, Selen small in foreground

**IMAGE PROMPT**:
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, threat detection,
environment watching protagonist, predator eyes,
alive with attention,

Selen moving cautiously, but she's not alone,
the environment itself seems to watch her - eye-like growths in plants,
vegetation parting slightly as something tracks her,
bioluminescent "eyes" appearing in bark, leaves, ground,
the Ex-Zone is one organism, and she's inside it,

Camera: over-shoulder, paranoid framing
Composition: Selen navigating, hostile environment surrounding
Lighting: shifting bioluminescent, shadows that move
```

**SELEN (thought balloon)**: "I'm being watched."

SELEN-PRIME revealed, battle-scarred version of protagonist,
mirror shattered,

TWIST REVEAL: Stepping from the jungle - SELEN-PRIME,
same elongated face, same angular features, same impossible height, but DIFFERENT,
scars on her face and arms like constellations, eyes showing exhaustion,
clothes are Ex-Zone grown, fused with her skin in places, organic armor,
holding a bio-weapon that extends from her arm like a thorn,
expression cold and unsurprised, predator patience,
she's been waiting,
NO violet thread - that's Selen's rebellion, not hers,

Camera: dramatic reveal shot, low angle
Composition: Selen-Prime dominant in frame, weapon visible
Lighting: dramatic backlight from bioluminescence, face partially shadowed
