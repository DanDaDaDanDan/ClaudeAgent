# Veridia: Art Style Guide

## Core Visual DNA

This comic draws from Peter Chung's Aeon Flux (1991-1995 animated series), blending:
- **Elongated, angular anatomy** - Bodies are impossibly lithe, joints hyperextended
- **Brutalist organic architecture** - Cold geometric forms fused with wet, biological elements
- **High-fashion violence** - Action posed like editorial photography
- **Sterile meets visceral** - Clinical whites splashed with organic corruption

## Color Palette

### Veridia (The City)
```
Primary: Arctic White (#F8F9FA), Steel Gray (#6C757D)
Accent: Surgical Teal (#20C997), Warning Crimson (#DC3545)
Flesh tones: Porcelain pale, almost bloodless
```

### Ex-Zone (The Wilds)
```

Accent: Infection Yellow (#FDD835), Arterial Red (#B71C1C)
Organic textures: Wet, glistening, translucent membranes
```

### The Border
```
Mixed palette - Veridia's sterility breaking down into Ex-Zone corruption
Heavy shadows, chiaroscuro lighting
Smoke, mist, particulate matter
```

## Character Design Principles

### Body Language
- **Veridia citizens**: Controlled, geometric poses; minimal wasted movement
- **Ex-Zone inhabitants**: Fluid, organic, predatory stances
- **Border guards**: Tense, coiled, ready to spring

### Fashion Notes
- **Veridia**: Sleek bodysuit derivatives, asymmetrical cuts, exposed geometric sections
- **Ex-Zone**: Grown rather than made; clothing fused with skin, symbiotic accessories
- **Military/Guards**: Biomechanical armor; living carapace over human form

### Facial Features
- Angular, high cheekbones
- Large, expressive eyes (almond-shaped)
- Thin lips, sharp jawlines
- Minimal expression in Veridia; raw emotion in Ex-Zone

## Architectural Style

### Veridia
- **Materials**: White concrete, black glass, chrome accents
- **Forms**: Impossible geometries - Escher-like staircases, inverted domes, floating platforms
- **Details**: Omnipresent surveillance nodes (organic eyes embedded in walls), sterile gardens with genetically perfect plants
- **Lighting**: Flat, shadowless artificial light; no visible source

### Ex-Zone
- **Materials**: Living tissue, chitin, bone, bioluminescent fluids
- **Forms**: Grown structures - buildings breathe, corridors contract, doorways dilate
- **Details**: Symbiotic relationships visible everywhere; walls have veins, floors have nerves
- **Lighting**: Bioluminescent glow, dappled through membrane skylights

### The Border
- **Materials**: Veridia structures being consumed by Ex-Zone growth
- **Forms**: Watchtowers with cancerous protrusions, walls with infection spreading
- **Details**: Combat damage, emergency repairs, bio-hazard containment
- **Lighting**: Harsh searchlights cutting through organic mist

## Panel Composition Rules

### Establishing Shots
Wide, architectural compositions emphasizing scale and alienation. Humans small against impossible structures.

### Dialogue Scenes
Medium shots with architectural elements framing characters. Use negative space to create tension.

### Action Sequences
Dynamic diagonals, motion blur on organic elements, impact shown through environment deformation.

### Psychological Moments
Close-ups with surreal backgrounds bleeding into the frame. Reality warping around emotional intensity.

### Silent Beats
Let the art breathe. Minimum 2-3 silent panels per story for emphasis. Use for:
- Reveals (page-turn surprise)
- Emotional processing
- Environmental atmosphere
- Pre-violence tension

## Image Generation Prompt Components

### Base Style Tags (use on ALL prompts)
```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, 1990s MTV animation aesthetic, bio-punk surrealism,
elongated angular anatomy, high fashion poses, brutalist organic architecture,
comic book panel art, clean line work with cel shading, dramatic lighting
```

### Location Tags

**Veridia Interior**:
```
sterile white brutalist interior, geometric impossible architecture,
chrome and glass accents, flat artificial lighting, surveillance eye nodes in walls,
minimalist clinical aesthetic, no shadows
```

**Veridia Exterior**:
```
white tower cityscape, floating geometric platforms, inverted domes,
perfect sterile sky, surveillance drones, citizens in formation below,
oppressive utopian architecture
```

**Ex-Zone**:
```
mutagenic jungle, bioluminescent organic structures, breathing walls,
living architecture made of flesh and chitin, hostile sentient vegetation,
wet glistening surfaces, bile green and bruise purple palette
```

**Border Zone**:
```
militarized wall structure, Veridia architecture being consumed by organic growth,
watchtowers with cancerous protrusions, searchlights through organic mist,
biosecurity checkpoints, quarantine aesthetics
```

### Character Pose Tags

**Combat/Action**:
```
dynamic diagonal composition, mid-action pose, hyperextended joints,
fashion editorial violence, impact deformation, motion trails
```

**Infiltration/Stealth**:
```
coiled tense pose, negative space emphasis, architectural shadows,
predatory stillness, elongated silhouette
```

**Emotional/Psychological**:
```
close-up with surreal background bleed, reality distortion,
expressive eyes, minimal facial movement, internal conflict visualization
```

**Surveillance/Observation**:
```
being watched composition, multiple eye motifs, panopticon framing,
subject aware of observation, paranoid atmosphere
```

### Mood Tags

**Tension**: `oppressive stillness, held breath, pre-violence quiet, coiled spring energy`

**Horror**: `body horror elegance, beautiful grotesque, clinical violation, sterile dread`

**Wonder**: `impossible scale, architectural sublime, alien beauty, surreal majesty`

**Intimacy**: `uncomfortably close framing, vulnerable geometry, exposed internal systems`

### Example Prompt

```
Peter Chung Aeon Flux inspired, 1990s MTV animation aesthetic, bio-punk surrealism,
elongated angular anatomy, comic book panel art, clean line work with cel shading,

sterile white brutalist interior, geometric impossible architecture,
chrome and glass accents, surveillance eye nodes in walls,

A tall angular woman with short black hair in asymmetrical white bodysuit,
standing at a data terminal made of living tissue, her hand inserted into
a membrane interface, expression distant and calculating,

oppressive stillness, clinical dread, being watched composition,

She is downloading forbidden memory files, organic cables connecting her wrist to the terminal,
multiple surveillance eyes in the background walls are all focused on her.

Camera: slightly low angle, emphasizing her height
Composition: subject in left third, terminal in center, surveillance eyes in right third
Lighting: flat artificial light from above, faint bioluminescent glow from terminal
```

## Do's and Don'ts

### DO
- Exaggerate anatomy for expressiveness
- Use architecture to convey emotional states
- Let panels breathe with negative space
- Make technology biological and unsettling
- Pose characters like fashion models, even in violence
- Use page-turn reveals for maximum impact

### DON'T
- Use realistic proportions (too grounded)
- Make technology purely mechanical (loses bio-punk identity)
- Clutter panels with unnecessary detail
- Use conventional superhero action poses
- Explain visually what can be shown
- Waste silent panel opportunities
