## Cross-Reference Check

### Against Aeon Flux Canon
- Bregna (the city in Aeon Flux) → **Veridia** is distinct ✅
- Monica (state in Aeon Flux) → No equivalent ✅
- Trevor Goodchild → No similar names ✅
- Aeon Flux → No similar names ✅

### Against Jeff VanderMeer Works
- Area X (Annihilation) → Ex-Zone has different meaning ✅
- The Southern Reach → No equivalent ✅

### Against Philip K. Dick Works
- No name overlaps detected ✅

## Verdict

All names are **SUFFICIENTLY ORIGINAL** for publication.

Minor notes:
- "Ex-Zone" is functional but generic - could be enhanced to "The Feral Exterior" or similar
- "The Loop" is a common concept but our specific usage (generational soul recycling) is original
