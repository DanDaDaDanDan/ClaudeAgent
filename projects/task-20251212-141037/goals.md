# Project Goals

**Project**: task-20251212-141037
**Created**: 2025-12-12 14:10:37
**Task Type**: Creative - Comic Strip Generation

## Original Request
> Create a 3 panel comic strip along the lines of hagar the horrible. it should be extremely funny and be an A+ rated strip for humor. The characters should look consistent across panels.

## Iteration Triggers
- "A+" → Must achieve excellent humor quality, iterate until genuinely funny
- "extremely funny" → High bar for humor, not just mildly amusing
- Character consistency requirement → Need visual continuity across panels

## Scope
- **In scope**: 3-panel comic strip, viking/medieval humor style like Hagar, consistent character design, strong punchline
- **Out of scope**: Full comic series, animation, multiple strips

## Success Criteria
1. 3 distinct panels that form a coherent comic strip
2. Characters visually consistent across all panels (same design, colors, proportions)
3. Humor that lands with a strong punchline - genuinely funny, not just clever
4. Style reminiscent of classic newspaper comics (Hagar the Horrible aesthetic)
5. Clear visual storytelling - joke works without needing explanation

## Quality Bar
- **Minimum acceptable**: Coherent 3-panel strip with a joke that makes sense
- **Target**: Strip that would make someone chuckle out loud
- **Excellent would mean**: A+ humor - the kind of strip people share because it's genuinely hilarious

## Model Configuration
- **default_model**: claude (using mcp-fal for images)
