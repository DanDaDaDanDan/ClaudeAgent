## Panel Review

### Panel 1 - Setup
- ✅ Viking bursting through door triumphantly
- ✅ Speech bubble: "HONEY, I'M HOME FROM THE RAID! HUGE SUCCESS!"
- ✅ Classic cartoon style with bold outlines
- ✅ Character: Red-bearded viking with horned helmet, fur tunic
- ✅ "HAGAR" label visible - nice touch

### Panel 2 - Development
- ✅ Wife with blonde braids, green dress, white apron - matches description
- ✅ Viking with red beard, horned helmet - consistent with panel 1
- ✅ Speech bubble: "WHAT DID YOU BRING BACK?"
- ✅ She looks appropriately skeptical
- ⚠️ Viking has a basket and lute - adds intrigue
- ✅ Same wooden house interior setting

### Panel 3 - Punchline
- ✅ Viking proudly holding "I ♥ ENGLAND" magnet
- ✅ Wife facepalming in background - perfect reaction
- ✅ Viking has big proud grin - comedy gold
- ⚠️ Viking's helmet style slightly different (no horns visible)
- ✅ Punchline lands - the anticlimax is hilarious

## Character Consistency
- Viking: ~85% consistent (beard color, body type, tunic all match; helmet varies slightly)
- Wife: ~90% consistent (blonde braids, green dress, apron all match; position changes naturally)

## Humor Assessment
- Setup: Clear and effective ✅
- Development: Good tension building ✅
- Punchline: Strong anticlimax, wife's facepalm sells it ✅
- Overall: Genuinely funny - the contrast between "HUGE SUCCESS" and a tacky souvenir magnet works

## Quality Rating
**B+ / A-** - Very good, but could iterate for A+

## Issues to Address for A+
1. Minor: Helmet style varies slightly between panels
2. The joke lands well but could potentially be even sharper

## Recommendation
This is already quite good! The joke structure works, the visual comedy with the wife's facepalm is perfect.

**Decision**: Present to user and offer iteration if they want even more polish.
