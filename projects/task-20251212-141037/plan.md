# Plan

**Task**: Create A+ humor 3-panel comic strip in Hagar the Horrible style
**Status**: 🟡 IN PROGRESS

## Approach
Create a viking-themed comic strip with:
1. Strong setup → development → punchline structure
2. Character consistency through detailed, repeated character descriptions
3. Classic newspaper comic aesthetic
4. Subverted expectations for maximum humor

## Comic Concept: "The Raid Report"

**Characters**:
- Hagar-style viking chief: Big burly bearded viking with horned helmet, red beard, round belly, brown fur tunic
- Viking wife: Stern-looking woman with blonde braids, green dress, hands on hips

**The Joke**:
- Panel 1: Viking returns home triumphantly from a raid, announcing great success
- Panel 2: Wife asks what he brought back
- Panel 3: He proudly presents... a refrigerator magnet that says "I ♥ England" (absurd anticlimax)

**Why it works**:
- Classic Hagar formula: tough viking vs domestic reality
- Subverted expectations: epic raid → tourist souvenir
- Relatable humor: bringing back tacky souvenirs from trips
- Visual comedy: the contrast between the epic viking and tiny tacky magnet

## Phases
1. ✅ Define joke structure and characters
2. 🟡 Generate panels with consistent character descriptions
3. ⬜ Assess humor quality
4. ⬜ Iterate if needed
5. ⬜ Verify and deliver

## Character Consistency Strategy
Use identical, detailed character description in each panel prompt:
- "burly viking man with large red bushy beard, horned metal helmet, round belly, brown fur tunic, leather belt, brown boots"
- "stern viking woman with blonde hair in two long braids, green medieval dress, white apron"
