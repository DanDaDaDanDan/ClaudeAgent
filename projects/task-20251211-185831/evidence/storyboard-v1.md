- **6-9s**: First tiny spark of light appears at tree's base

### Motion Direction
- Slow, almost imperceptible push-in toward tree
- Snow particles drifting gently
- At 7-8 seconds: small golden light flickers at tree roots

### Mood
Cold, lonely, quiet anticipation

## SHOT 2: "The Awakening" (9-18 seconds)
**Purpose**: THE BUILD - Transformation begins, build anticipation

### Visual Description
Close-up on the tree trunk and lower branches. Golden-pink magical energy begins flowing up through the bark like glowing veins. Frost starts melting. Tiny buds appear and begin to swell. The first impossible flowers start to bloom - luminescent, fantastical colors.

### Key Moments
- **9-12s**: Energy visibly flows up trunk, frost melts
- **12-15s**: Buds appear rapidly along branches
- **15-18s**: First flowers bloom open, releasing small motes of light

### Motion Direction

Wonder, anticipation building, magic is real

## SHOT 3: "Full Bloom" (18-27 seconds)
**Purpose**: THE PAYOFF - Explosive transformation, maximum visual satisfaction

### Visual Description
Wide shot revealing the full tree now in spectacular magical bloom. Impossible flowers in luminescent pink, purple, gold, and cyan cover every branch. The entire landscape has transformed - grass has sprouted green through the snow, other plants are blooming, butterflies and light particles fill the air. The sky has cleared to golden-hour warmth.

### Key Moments
- **18-21s**: Rapid bloom explosion across entire tree
- **21-24s**: Environment transformation (snow melting, grass growing)
- **24-27s**: Final beauty shot - butterflies, floating petals, golden light

### Motion Direction
