## Consistency Reference

**Use these images as reference for all generations:**

| Tree | Ancient, gnarled trunk, many upward branches, distinctive silhouette |

## Troubleshooting

**If tree looks different between shots:**
- Use the Shot 1 Start Frame as reference image for all generations
- Focus prompts on "same ancient gnarled tree"

**If colors are inconsistent:**
- Emphasize "luminescent pink, purple, cyan, gold" in flower prompts
- Keep "golden-pink magical energy" consistent

**If motion is too fast/slow:**
- Adjust video prompts: "very slow" or "rapid" as needed
- Most models default to medium pace

**If video looks static:**
- Emphasize motion words: "flowing", "drifting", "blooming", "floating"
- Ensure end frame is visually different from start frame
