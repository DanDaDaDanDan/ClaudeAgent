```
Style: hyperrealistic fantasy, cinematic lighting, photorealistic textures,
8k ultra detailed, dramatic scale contrast, vertical 9:16 composition,
professional photography, shallow depth of field where appropriate,
film grain subtle, atmospheric
```

---

## SHOT 1 FRAMES

### Start Frame: The Hook (CRITICAL)

```
Extreme low angle photograph looking straight up from ground level at a giant
worn leather boot descending from above, the boot fills the upper 60% of the
frame with dramatic foreshortening, motion blur on the boot suggesting downward
movement, below the boot is cracked grey concrete sidewalk with a prominent
dark crack/crevice in the center, dust particles visible in the harsh sunlight,
hyperrealistic street photography style, threatening perspective, tension,
vertical composition 9:16, photorealistic, 8k detail, dramatic shadows,
the boot is about to step down
```

**TEXT SPACE**: Bottom 20% of frame must be relatively clear for "Wait—" overlay

### End Frame: City Discovery

```
Aerial view looking down at a breathtaking miniature fantasy city built inside
an underground cavern, the city is constructed from giant glowing mushroom caps
serving as buildings, crystalline spires, structures made from acorn shells and
natural materials, streets lit by bioluminescent plants in cyan and amber,
tiny silhouetted figures visible on the streets below, the cavern ceiling is
visible above with roots hanging down, magical atmosphere, warm amber and cool
cyan bioluminescent lighting, fantasy realism, miniature world, tilt-shift
photography effect, vertical composition 9:16, 8k ultra detailed, we are
floating above this hidden civilization
```

### FALLBACK FRAMES (If Using Sub-Shot Approach)

#### Frame 1a-end: Boot Frozen
```
Extreme low angle looking up at a giant worn leather boot frozen mid-step
just above the ground, the boot hovers motionless, dust particles suspended
in air around it, cracked concrete sidewalk below with prominent dark crevice,
frozen moment in time, tension, hyperrealistic, vertical 9:16, 8k
```

#### Frame 1b-start: Crack Close-Up
```
Looking straight down into a dark crack in grey concrete sidewalk, the crack
edges frame the shot, we are about to fall in, darkness below, faint warm
glow barely visible deep down, hyperrealistic, vertical 9:16
```

#### Frame 1b-end: Falling Through Darkness
```
Falling through a dark void, layers of soil and roots visible on the walls
rushing past, motion blur suggesting rapid descent, warm bioluminescent glow
growing brighter below, sense of speed and depth, vertical 9:16
```

---

## SHOT 2 FRAMES

### Start Frame: City Aerial

```
Sweeping aerial view of a fantastical miniature underground city, giant
mushroom cap buildings with windows carved into the stems, crystalline towers
that glow from within, walkways made of woven grass bridges, a central plaza
with a massive ancient tree whose roots glow with golden veins, tiny humanoid
figures walking the bioluminescent streets, architecture that blends organic
and magical elements, warm amber streetlights from glowing flowers, cool cyan
accent lighting from crystal formations, atmospheric fog at ground level,
fantasy realism style, miniature world photography, vertical composition 9:16,
8k hyperdetailed, magical civilization hidden underground
```

### End Frame: Beings Looking Up

```
Ground level view inside the miniature underground city, we are at the base of
the great central tree, a crowd of tiny humanoid figures gathered looking
upward toward the cavern ceiling, their faces lit by the ambient bioluminescent
glow, one figure in the foreground points upward with arm raised, the figures
wear clothing made from leaves and woven natural materials, their features are
ambiguous but clearly intelligent beings, the great tree trunk behind them
pulses with golden light in its bark, sense of wonder and concern on their
faces, they are aware of something above, dramatic upward perspective, fantasy
realism, vertical composition 9:16, 8k detailed, emotional moment
```

---

## SHOT 3 FRAMES

### Start Frame: Rising Through Cavern

```
Vertical view looking up through an underground cavern toward a bright opening
above, we are rising upward, the cavern walls show multiple levels of the
miniature civilization - cities built into the walls, glowing root networks
connecting settlements, bridges spanning the void, tiny lights from countless
windows, the crack of light above represents the surface world, sense of vast
scale and hidden depth, multiple miniature cities visible at different levels,
bioluminescent plants and crystals line the walls, dramatic vertical composition
rising toward the light, fantasy realism, 9:16 aspect ratio, 8k detail,
awe-inspiring underground world
```

### End Frame: Wide Shot with Wave (UPDATED - Enhanced Visibility)

```
Ground level photograph of a cracked concrete sidewalk in daylight, focus on
a prominent crack in the center of frame, at the edge of the crack opening
stands a tiny humanoid figure approximately 1 centimeter tall, the figure has
a SUBTLE GOLDEN GLOW around it making it clearly visible despite small size,
the figure is waving upward toward the camera with one arm raised enthusiastically,
in the background slightly out of focus is a large worn boot frozen mid-step,
harsh daylight casting long shadows, the mundane surface world contrasted with
the magical tiny glowing figure, other cracks in the sidewalk have faint warm
glow suggesting more hidden worlds, hyperrealistic street photography, vertical
composition 9:16, the tiny glowing figure is the clear focal point, 8k photorealistic
```

**TEXT SPACE**: Center of frame needs space for "They're everywhere. Look closer."

**CRITICAL**: The tiny figure MUST be visible on a phone screen. The subtle glow ensures it catches the eye without looking too magical for the surface world.

## SUPPLEMENTARY DETAIL FRAME (Optional)

### Street Level Life Close-Up
*Use if you want extra footage for Shot 2*

```
Close-up street level view inside the miniature underground city, a tiny
humanoid figure in the foreground carries a large dewdrop balanced on their
shoulder like a water jug, beside them a bioluminescent mushroom serves as a
street lamp casting cyan light, tiny market stalls made from seed pods in the
background, cobblestone-like path made from pebbles, incredible detail in the
miniature architecture, fantasy realism, warm and cool lighting contrast,
vertical composition 9:16, 8k hyperdetailed, miniature world at eye level
```

## GENERATION ORDER (Recommended)

1. **Shot 1 End Frame** (city aerial) - Establishes the world
2. **Shot 2 Start Frame** - Use #1 as style reference
3. **Shot 2 End Frame** - Use #1 as style reference
4. **Shot 3 Start Frame** - Use #1 as style reference
5. **Shot 1 Start Frame** (shoe) - Different style, realistic
6. **Shot 3 End Frame** (wave) - Bridges both styles

This order ensures underground world consistency before generating the realistic surface shots.

## CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST

Before generating all images, verify:
- [ ] All use 9:16 vertical aspect ratio
- [ ] Bioluminescent colors consistent (cyan/amber/gold)
- [ ] Tiny beings have consistent ambiguous-humanoid design
- [ ] Mushroom architecture style maintained
- [ ] Surface world is muted/realistic, underground is magical
- [ ] Shot 1 start has text space at bottom
- [ ] Shot 3 end has text space in center
- [ ] Tiny figure in Shot 3 end has glow for visibility
