## THE CONCEPT IN 30 SECONDS

1. **HOOK (0-2s)**: Giant shoe about to crush something. Text: "Wait—"
2. **DIVE (2-8s)**: Camera plunges into crack, discovers magical underground city
3. **EXPLORE (8-18s)**: Floating tour of miniature civilization - mushroom buildings, tiny beings, glowing plants
4. **REVEAL (18-24s)**: Pull back to surface, tiny figure waves up at camera
5. **CTA (24-27s)**: Text: "They're everywhere. Look closer."

## PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Generate the 6 Key Images

Generate in this order for consistency:

#### Image 1: Underground City (Shot 1 End Frame)
*Generate this first - it establishes the world*

```
Aerial view looking down at a breathtaking miniature fantasy city built inside
an underground cavern, the city is constructed from giant glowing mushroom caps
serving as buildings, crystalline spires, structures made from acorn shells and
natural materials, streets lit by bioluminescent plants in cyan and amber,
tiny silhouetted figures visible on the streets below, the cavern ceiling is
visible above with roots hanging down, magical atmosphere, warm amber and cool
cyan bioluminescent lighting, fantasy realism, miniature world, tilt-shift
photography effect, vertical composition 9:16, 8k ultra detailed, we are
floating above this hidden civilization
```

#### Image 2: The Hook Shot (Shot 1 Start Frame)
*The most important frame - this stops the scroll*

```
Extreme low angle photograph looking straight up from ground level at a giant
worn leather boot descending from above, the boot fills the upper 60% of the
frame with dramatic foreshortening, motion blur on the boot suggesting downward
movement, below the boot is cracked grey concrete sidewalk with a prominent
dark crack/crevice in the center, dust particles visible in the harsh sunlight,
hyperrealistic street photography style, threatening perspective, tension,
vertical composition 9:16, photorealistic, 8k detail, dramatic shadows,
the boot is about to step down
```
**Note**: Leave space at bottom-center for "Wait—" text

#### Image 3: Street Level City (Shot 2 Start Frame)
*Use Image 1 as reference*

```
Sweeping aerial view of a fantastical miniature underground city, giant
mushroom cap buildings with windows carved into the stems, crystalline towers
that glow from within, walkways made of woven grass bridges, a central plaza
with a massive ancient tree whose roots glow with golden veins, tiny humanoid
figures walking the bioluminescent streets, architecture that blends organic
and magical elements, warm amber streetlights from glowing flowers, cool cyan
accent lighting from crystal formations, atmospheric fog at ground level,
fantasy realism style, miniature world photography, vertical composition 9:16,
8k hyperdetailed, magical civilization hidden underground
```

#### Image 4: Beings Looking Up (Shot 2 End Frame)
*Use Image 1 as reference*

```
Ground level view inside the miniature underground city, we are at the base of
the great central tree, a crowd of tiny humanoid figures gathered looking
upward toward the cavern ceiling, their faces lit by the ambient bioluminescent
glow, one figure in the foreground points upward with arm raised, the figures
wear clothing made from leaves and woven natural materials, their features are
ambiguous but clearly intelligent beings, the great tree trunk behind them
pulses with golden light in its bark, sense of wonder and concern on their
faces, they are aware of something above, dramatic upward perspective, fantasy
realism, vertical composition 9:16, 8k detailed, emotional moment
```

#### Image 5: Rising Through Cavern (Shot 3 Start Frame)

```
Vertical view looking up through an underground cavern toward a bright opening
above, we are rising upward, the cavern walls show multiple levels of the
miniature civilization - cities built into the walls, glowing root networks
connecting settlements, bridges spanning the void, tiny lights from countless
windows, the crack of light above represents the surface world, sense of vast
scale and hidden depth, multiple miniature cities visible at different levels,
bioluminescent plants and crystals line the walls, dramatic vertical composition
rising toward the light, fantasy realism, 9:16 aspect ratio, 8k detail,
awe-inspiring underground world
```

#### Image 6: Final Wide Shot (Shot 3 End Frame)

```
Ground level photograph of a cracked concrete sidewalk in daylight, focus on
a prominent crack in the center of frame, at the edge of the crack opening
stands an incredibly tiny humanoid figure barely visible, the figure is waving
upward toward the camera with one arm raised, in the background slightly out
of focus is a large worn boot/shoe frozen mid-step, harsh daylight casting
shadows, the mundane surface world contrasted with the tiny magical figure,
other cracks in the concrete subtly hint at faint inner glow, hyperrealistic
street photography, vertical composition 9:16, the tiny figure is the focal
point despite its small size, 8k photorealistic, leave space in center for
text overlay "They're everywhere. Look closer."
```

### Step 2: Generate the 3 Videos

#### Video 1 (8 seconds)
**Input**: Image 2 (shoe) → Image 1 (city aerial)

```
Dramatic camera movement sequence: starts looking up at giant boot descending,
boot freezes mid-air for one beat, then camera rapidly dives downward into the
crack in the sidewalk, falling through layers of concrete and soil into darkness,
speed increases during descent, suddenly warm bioluminescent light appears below,
camera emerges into vast underground cavern, slowing down as it floats above a
glowing miniature city, dust particles throughout, motion blur during fast descent,
smooth deceleration at end, cinematic, 8 seconds
```

#### Video 2 (10 seconds)
**Input**: Image 3 (city aerial) → Image 4 (beings looking up)

```
Smooth floating camera movement exploring a magical underground miniature city,
camera glides gently downward from aerial view, passing by glowing mushroom
buildings and crystal spires, descending into the streets where tiny humanoid
figures walk, passing close to a bioluminescent streetlamp, continuing toward
a central plaza with a great glowing tree, camera settles at ground level where
a crowd of tiny figures has gathered looking upward, one figure points up,
dreamy floating movement throughout, gentle exploration feel, particles of light
drift upward, 10 seconds
```

#### Video 3 (9 seconds)
**Input**: Image 5 (rising cavern) → Image 6 (wide shot)

```
Camera rises upward through a vast underground cavern revealing multiple levels
of miniature civilizations built into the walls, glowing cities and root networks
visible on all sides, ascending toward a bright opening above, camera emerges
from the crack into daylight, transitions to ground level view of sidewalk crack,
a tiny figure stands at the edge of the crack and waves upward, camera slowly
pulls back to reveal the frozen boot in background and full sidewalk scene,
hold on wide shot with subtle glow hints in other cracks, upward movement then
pullback, dramatic scale shift, 9 seconds
```

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Why People Will Comment

| Trigger | Expected Comments |
|---------|-------------------|
| "They're everywhere" | "Now I'm scared to walk" / "Checking every crack now" |
| AI speculation | "Is this real?" / "It's AI" / "How did you make this?" |
| Emotional reaction | "Why did this make me emotional" / "The wave broke me" |
| Tagging | People tagging friends who need to see this |

### Maximizing Engagement

1. **Reply to early comments** - First hour is critical
2. **Pin a question** - "Should I show what's in YOUR backyard?"
3. **Make a Part 2 hint** - Creates anticipation
4. **React to "is this real" comments** - Engagement gold

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If the shoe doesn't look threatening enough
- Emphasize "extreme low angle, foreshortening, descending, motion blur"
- Make sure boot fills 60%+ of frame

### If underground cities look inconsistent
- Use first city image as reference for all underground shots
- Key consistent elements: mushroom buildings, cyan/amber glow, tiny figures

### If the scale shift isn't working
- Break Shot 1 into multiple shorter clips
- Add a "diving into darkness" transition frame

### If the tiny figure wave isn't visible
- Make figure slightly larger (still tiny relative to scene)
- Add subtle glow/highlight around the figure
