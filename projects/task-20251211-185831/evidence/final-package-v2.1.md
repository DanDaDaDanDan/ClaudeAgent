## QUICK START

**Concept**: A 27-second TikTok discovering a hidden miniature civilization living in sidewalk cracks.

**Hook**: Giant shoe about to crush something → "Wait—" → dive into crack → magical world revealed

**Why it will go viral**:
- Pattern interrupt in frame 1 (descending shoe = instant threat)
- Curiosity gap forces completion
- AI fantasy content gets 41% more distribution
- Built-in comment bait ("They're everywhere")
- Trending sound (50K videos/day)

# PRODUCTION GUIDE

## Step 1: Generate Images (6-9 frames)

### Required Frames

**1. THE HOOK - Shoe Above (Shot 1 Start)**
```
Extreme low angle photograph looking straight up from ground level at a giant
worn leather boot descending from above, the boot fills the upper 60% of the
frame with dramatic foreshortening, motion blur on the boot suggesting downward
movement, below the boot is cracked grey concrete sidewalk with a prominent
dark crack/crevice in the center, dust particles visible in the harsh sunlight,
hyperrealistic street photography style, threatening perspective, tension,
vertical composition 9:16, photorealistic, 8k detail, dramatic shadows,
the boot is about to step down
```
*Leave bottom 20% clear for "Wait—" text*

---

**2. UNDERGROUND CITY - Aerial (Shot 1 End / Shot 2 Start)**
*Generate this first - it establishes the world style*
```
Aerial view looking down at a breathtaking miniature fantasy city built inside
an underground cavern, the city is constructed from giant glowing mushroom caps
serving as buildings, crystalline spires, structures made from acorn shells and
natural materials, streets lit by bioluminescent plants in cyan and amber,
tiny silhouetted figures visible on the streets below, the cavern ceiling is
visible above with roots hanging down, magical atmosphere, warm amber and cool
cyan bioluminescent lighting, fantasy realism, miniature world, tilt-shift
photography effect, vertical composition 9:16, 8k ultra detailed, we are
floating above this hidden civilization
```

---

**3. BEINGS LOOKING UP (Shot 2 End)**
```
Ground level view inside the miniature underground city, we are at the base of
the great central tree, a crowd of tiny humanoid figures gathered looking
upward toward the cavern ceiling, their faces lit by the ambient bioluminescent
glow, one figure in the foreground points upward with arm raised, the figures
wear clothing made from leaves and woven natural materials, their features are
ambiguous but clearly intelligent beings, the great tree trunk behind them
pulses with golden light in its bark, sense of wonder and concern on their
faces, they are aware of something above, dramatic upward perspective, fantasy
realism, vertical composition 9:16, 8k detailed, emotional moment
```

---

**4. RISING THROUGH CAVERN (Shot 3 Start)**
```
Vertical view looking up through an underground cavern toward a bright opening
above, we are rising upward, the cavern walls show multiple levels of the
miniature civilization - cities built into the walls, glowing root networks
connecting settlements, bridges spanning the void, tiny lights from countless
windows, the crack of light above represents the surface world, sense of vast
scale and hidden depth, multiple miniature cities visible at different levels,
bioluminescent plants and crystals line the walls, dramatic vertical composition
rising toward the light, fantasy realism, 9:16 aspect ratio, 8k detail,
awe-inspiring underground world
```

---

**5. THE WAVE - Final Shot (Shot 3 End)**
```
Ground level photograph of a cracked concrete sidewalk in daylight, focus on
a prominent crack in the center of frame, at the edge of the crack opening
stands a tiny humanoid figure approximately 1 centimeter tall, the figure has
a SUBTLE GOLDEN GLOW around it making it clearly visible despite small size,
the figure is waving upward toward the camera with one arm raised enthusiastically,
in the background slightly out of focus is a large worn boot frozen mid-step,
harsh daylight casting long shadows, the mundane surface world contrasted with
the magical tiny glowing figure, other cracks in the sidewalk have faint warm
glow suggesting more hidden worlds, hyperrealistic street photography, vertical
composition 9:16, the tiny glowing figure is the clear focal point, 8k photorealistic
```
*Leave center clear for "They're everywhere. Look closer." text*

---

### Optional Fallback Frames (If Shot 1 is too complex)

**1a-end. Boot Frozen**
```
Extreme low angle looking up at a giant worn leather boot frozen mid-step
just above the ground, the boot hovers motionless, dust particles suspended
in air around it, cracked concrete sidewalk below with prominent dark crevice,
frozen moment in time, tension, hyperrealistic, vertical 9:16, 8k
```

**1b-start. Crack Close-Up**
```
Looking straight down into a dark crack in grey concrete sidewalk, the crack
edges frame the shot, we are about to fall in, darkness below, faint warm
glow barely visible deep down, hyperrealistic, vertical 9:16
```

**1b-end. Falling Through**
```
Falling through a dark void, layers of soil and roots visible on the walls
rushing past, motion blur suggesting rapid descent, warm bioluminescent glow
growing brighter below, sense of speed and depth, vertical 9:16
```

---

## Step 2: Generate Videos

### PRIMARY APPROACH (If model handles complex motion)

**Video 1 (8 seconds)**: Frame 1 → Frame 2
```
Dramatic camera movement sequence: starts looking up at giant boot descending,
boot freezes mid-air for one beat, then camera rapidly dives downward into the
crack in the sidewalk, falling through layers of concrete and soil into darkness,
speed increases during descent, suddenly warm bioluminescent light appears below,
camera emerges into vast underground cavern, slowing down as it floats above a
glowing miniature city, dust particles throughout, motion blur during fast descent,
smooth deceleration at end, cinematic, 8 seconds
```

**Video 2 (10 seconds)**: Frame 2 → Frame 3
```
Smooth floating camera movement exploring a magical underground miniature city,
camera glides gently downward from aerial view, passing by glowing mushroom
buildings and crystal spires, descending into the streets where tiny humanoid
figures walk, passing close to a bioluminescent streetlamp, continuing toward
a central plaza with a great glowing tree, camera settles at ground level where
a crowd of tiny figures has gathered looking upward, one figure points up,
dreamy floating movement throughout, gentle exploration feel, particles of light
drift upward, 10 seconds
```

**Video 3 (9 seconds)**: Frame 4 → Frame 5
```
Camera rises upward through a vast underground cavern revealing multiple levels
of miniature civilizations built into the walls, glowing cities and root networks
visible on all sides, ascending toward a bright opening above, camera emerges
from the crack into daylight, transitions to ground level view of sidewalk crack,
a tiny figure stands at the edge of the crack and waves upward, camera slowly
pulls back to reveal the frozen boot in background and full sidewalk scene,
hold on wide shot with subtle glow hints in other cracks, upward movement then
pullback, dramatic scale shift, 9 seconds
```

---

### FALLBACK APPROACH (For simpler models)

**Video 1a (3s)**: Boot descends and freezes
**Video 1b (2s)**: Dive into crack
**Video 1c (3s)**: Emerge above city
**Video 2 (8s)**: Float through city
**Video 3a (5s)**: Rise through cavern
**Video 3b (4-6s)**: Wave and pull back

## Step 3: Add Text Overlays

| Text | When | Where | Style |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| "Wait—" | 0-2s | Bottom-center | Bold white, drop shadow |
| "They're everywhere. Look closer." | 24-27s | Center | Fade in word-by-word |

---

## Step 4: Add Audio

**Primary Recommendation**:
"Powerful songs like action movie music" by Tansa
- 50K videos/day (trending but not oversaturated)
- Cinematic feel matches scale shift
- Search in TikTok: "Powerful songs action movie Tansa"

**Sync Points**:
| Time | Music |
|------|-------|
| 0-2s | Tension/build |
| 2-3s | Drop/whoosh |
| 8s | Wonder swell |
| 24s | Resolution |

---

## Step 5: Post Strategy

**Caption** (pick one):
- "POV: you almost destroyed an entire civilization"
- "I can't unsee this now"
- "Check your backyard. Just saying."

**Hashtags**:
```
#miniatureworld #fyp #viral #fantasy #aiart #pov #hiddenworld #mindblown
```

**Timing**: Tuesday-Thursday 10am/2pm/7pm EST

# SERIES POTENTIAL

Research shows series creators gain followers **4.1x faster** than one-off posters.

## Part 2 Ideas
| Location | Hook | Reveal |
|----------|------|--------|
| Under a garden rock | Hand about to grab rock | Entire kingdom |
| In a potted plant | Watering can pouring | Underwater civilization |
| Behind a wall crack | Demolition hammer | Vertical cliff city |
| Under fallen leaves | Rake approaching | Autumn festival happening |

## Series Format
Each video: Same "Wait—" hook structure, same "They're everywhere" ending, different location.

## Growth Strategy
- Part 1 goes viral → "Part 2?" comments flood in
- Pin comment: "Part 2 is coming... which location?"
- Release Part 2 within 48 hours while momentum is hot
- Each part references others ("They're everywhere")
