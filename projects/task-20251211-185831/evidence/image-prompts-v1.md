## SHOT 1: "The Frozen World"

### Start Frame (Required)

```
A majestic ancient gnarled tree stands alone in a vast frozen winter landscape,
heavy white frost covering every twisted branch, thick snow blanketing the
ground, overcast grey-blue twilight sky, mist in the distance, hauntingly
beautiful desolation, no other vegetation visible, the tree is centered in
frame, vertical composition 9:16 aspect ratio, cinematic wide shot, ethereal
atmospheric fog, photorealistic, 8k detail, dramatic cold lighting, fantasy
art style, professional nature photography
```

### End Frame (Optional - for guided motion)

```
Same ancient gnarled tree in frozen winter landscape, heavy frost on branches,
snow-covered ground, but now a small warm golden-pink light glows at the base
of the tree trunk near the roots, subtle magical sparkle, the first hint of
awakening, everything else remains frozen and cold, vertical composition 9:16,
cinematic, ethereal, photorealistic, 8k detail, contrast between cold
surroundings and warm glow
```

### Reference Image Notes

## SHOT 2: "The Awakening"

### Start Frame (Required)

```
Close-up view of an ancient tree trunk and lower branches, frost-covered bark
beginning to crack as golden-pink magical energy flows upward through the wood
like glowing veins beneath the surface, bioluminescent ethereal light, small
ice crystals melting and dripping, the very first tiny buds emerging on the
nearest branch, magical transformation in progress, vertical composition 9:16,
cinematic medium shot, fantasy art, highly detailed bark texture, warm magical
glow contrasting with remaining frost, 8k photorealistic detail
```

### End Frame (Optional - for guided motion)

```
Close-up of ancient tree trunk and branches now covered in swelling buds and
the first magical flowers beginning to bloom open, luminescent pink and gold
petals unfurling, glowing magical energy visible in the bark, frost completely
melted, small motes of golden light particles floating upward, fantastical
bioluminescent flowers, vertical composition 9:16, cinematic, ethereal fantasy
art, warm magical lighting, 8k highly detailed
