# Storyboard v2 - "The Tiny World You Almost Stepped On"

## Overview
**Total Duration**: 27 seconds (3 shots)
**Format**: 9:16 vertical (TikTok native)
**Style**: Hyperrealistic fantasy, cinematic, dramatic scale contrast

---

## SHOT 1: "The Threat + Discovery" (0-8 seconds)
**Purpose**: PATTERN INTERRUPT HOOK → Curiosity payoff

### Visual Sequence

**Frame 0-1s (THE HOOK)**:
- Extreme low angle looking UP
- Giant worn sneaker/boot filling top of frame, descending
- Motion blur suggesting movement downward
- Crack in concrete sidewalk visible below
- **TEXT OVERLAY**: "Wait—" (white, bold, center-bottom)
- Mood: TENSION, THREAT

**Frame 1-3s (THE PAUSE)**:
- Shoe freezes mid-descent
- Camera holds for beat
- Dust particles frozen in air
- Viewer's brain: "What? Why stop?"

**Frame 3-8s (THE DIVE)**:
- Camera plunges DOWN into the crack
- Rapid descent through layers of concrete, soil, roots
- Gets darker, then suddenly—LIGHT
- Emerges into a vast underground cavern
- First glimpse of the miniature world below
- Glowing lights visible in distance

### Key Technical Notes
- This is ONE continuous shot (or appears to be)
- The "zoom into crack" must feel like falling/diving
- Scale shift is the magic moment - must be seamless
- End frame: We're hovering above a miniature city

## SHOT 2: "The Hidden World" (8-18 seconds)
**Purpose**: EXPLORATION, WONDER, DETAIL DELIVERY

### Visual Sequence

**Frame 8-11s (CITY REVEAL)**:
- Sweeping aerial view of miniature city
- Buildings made from: mushroom caps, acorn shells, crystals
- Streets lit by bioluminescent plants
- Tiny figures walking below (silhouettes)
- Architecture feels ancient and magical

**Frame 11-14s (LIFE CLOSE-UP)**:
- Camera descends into the city
- Pass by a glowing mushroom "streetlamp"
- Tiny creature (mouse-sized humanoid? fairy? ambiguous) tends a garden
- Another carries a dewdrop like a water jug
- Details reward close watching

**Frame 14-18s (THE HEART)**:
- Camera reaches the city center
- A great tree grows here, roots wrapped with glowing veins
- Dozens of tiny beings gathered
- They seem to be looking UP - toward where we came from
- One figure points upward (toward the shoe above)

### Key Technical Notes
- Camera should feel like floating/gliding
- Multiple points of visual interest for replays
- Creatures should be visible but not fully detailed (mystery)
- Everything glows subtly - bioluminescent aesthetic

---

## SHOT 3: "The Connection" (18-27 seconds)
**Purpose**: EMOTIONAL PAYOFF + CALL TO ACTION

### Visual Sequence

**Frame 18-21s (THE PULL BACK)**:
- Camera rises back up through the cavern
- We see more of the underground world as we ascend
- Multiple cities connected by glowing root networks
- Scale becomes apparent - this is VAST

**Frame 21-24s (THE WAVE)**:
- We emerge from the crack
- Now at ground level, looking INTO the crack
- A tiny figure stands at the edge of the crack opening
- It waves UP at the camera/viewer
- The giant shoe is visible in background, still frozen

**Frame 24-27s (THE MESSAGE)**:
- Camera slowly pulls back further
- We see: crack, frozen shoe, normal sidewalk
- **TEXT OVERLAY**: "They're everywhere. Look closer."
- Hold on wide shot
- Subtle: other cracks in sidewalk now seem to glow faintly

### Key Technical Notes
- The wave is the emotional beat - connection across scales
- Final text must land with impact
- The "other cracks glowing" is a subtle detail for replays
- End frame should feel like a complete thought

## Visual Consistency Guide

### Scale Reference
- Human shoe = building-sized to the tiny world
- Crack in sidewalk = canyon entrance
- Dust particle = boulder-sized
- Grass blade = tree-sized

### Color Palette
| Zone | Colors |
|------|--------|
| Surface world | Muted greys, browns, concrete tones |
| Transition | Dark, then warm glow emerging |
| Underground | Bioluminescent cyan, warm amber, deep purple, living green |
| Magic elements | Soft white glow, golden particles |

### Lighting
- Surface: Harsh daylight, realistic shadows
- Underground: No sun - all light is bioluminescent/magical
- Contrast between "mundane above" and "magical below"

### Creature Design
- Ambiguous but humanoid (could be fairies, could be tiny people, could be unknown)
- Dressed in natural materials (leaves, moss, woven grass)
- Proportions slightly off (larger eyes, smaller bodies) for "otherworldly" feel
- NOT cartoon - grounded fantasy realism

## Text Overlay Specifications

### "Wait—"
- **Timing**: 0s - 2s
- **Position**: Center-bottom, above safe zone
- **Font**: Bold sans-serif, white with subtle drop shadow
- **Size**: Large (readable on phone)
- **Animation**: Quick fade in, hold

### "They're everywhere. Look closer."
- **Timing**: 24s - 27s (fade in at 24s)
- **Position**: Center, middle-third of screen
- **Font**: Same as above for consistency
- **Size**: Medium-large
- **Animation**: Fade in word by word: "They're everywhere." [beat] "Look closer."

## Transition Notes

### Shot 1 → Shot 2
- Seamless continuation - camera never stops moving
- We enter the cavern and emerge above the city

### Shot 2 → Shot 3
- Cut on the "looking up" moment
- Shot 3 starts with us already rising

---

## Production Notes

### For Image Generation
- Shot 1: Need start frame (shoe above) and end frame (hovering over city)
- Shot 2: Need start frame (city aerial) and end frame (beings looking up)
- Shot 3: Need start frame (rising through cavern) and end frame (wide shot with text zone)

### For Video Generation
- Shot 1: Strong downward→diving motion, speed ramp (slow→fast→revealing)
- Shot 2: Gentle floating glide, exploratory feel
- Shot 3: Upward rise, then gentle pull back

### Critical Success Factors
1. Shoe must look REAL and threatening in frame 1
2. Scale shift must be believable and magical
3. Underground world must reward re-watching with details
4. The wave must feel emotionally resonant
5. Final text must land as a "whoa" moment
