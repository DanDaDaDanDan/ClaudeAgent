## SHOT 1: "The Threat + Discovery"

### Start Frame (CRITICAL - This is the hook)

```
Extreme low angle photograph looking straight up from ground level at a giant
worn leather boot descending from above, the boot fills the upper 60% of the
frame with dramatic foreshortening, motion blur on the boot suggesting downward
movement, below the boot is cracked grey concrete sidewalk with a prominent
dark crack/crevice in the center, dust particles visible in the harsh sunlight,
hyperrealistic street photography style, threatening perspective, tension,
vertical composition 9:16, photorealistic, 8k detail, dramatic shadows,
the boot is about to step down
```

**IMPORTANT**: Leave clear space at bottom-center for "Wait—" text overlay

### End Frame (City Discovery)

```
Aerial view looking down at a breathtaking miniature fantasy city built inside
an underground cavern, the city is constructed from giant glowing mushroom caps
serving as buildings, crystalline spires, structures made from acorn shells and
natural materials, streets lit by bioluminescent plants in cyan and amber,
tiny silhouetted figures visible on the streets below, the cavern ceiling is
visible above with roots hanging down, magical atmosphere, warm amber and cool
cyan bioluminescent lighting, fantasy realism, miniature world, tilt-shift
photography effect, vertical composition 9:16, 8k ultra detailed, we are
floating above this hidden civilization
```

## SHOT 2: "The Hidden World"

### Start Frame (City Aerial)

```
Sweeping aerial view of a fantastical miniature underground city, giant
mushroom cap buildings with windows carved into the stems, crystalline towers
that glow from within, walkways made of woven grass bridges, a central plaza
with a massive ancient tree whose roots glow with golden veins, tiny humanoid
figures walking the bioluminescent streets, architecture that blends organic
and magical elements, warm amber streetlights from glowing flowers, cool cyan
accent lighting from crystal formations, atmospheric fog at ground level,
fantasy realism style, miniature world photography, vertical composition 9:16,
8k hyperdetailed, magical civilization hidden underground
```

### End Frame (Beings Looking Up)

```
Ground level view inside the miniature underground city, we are at the base of
the great central tree, a crowd of tiny humanoid figures gathered looking
upward toward the cavern ceiling, their faces lit by the ambient bioluminescent
glow, one figure in the foreground points upward with arm raised, the figures
wear clothing made from leaves and woven natural materials, their features are
ambiguous but clearly intelligent beings, the great tree trunk behind them
pulses with golden light in its bark, sense of wonder and concern on their
faces, they are aware of something above, dramatic upward perspective, fantasy
realism, vertical composition 9:16, 8k detailed, emotional moment
```

## SHOT 3: "The Connection"

### Start Frame (Rising Through Cavern)

```
Vertical view looking up through an underground cavern toward a bright opening
above, we are rising upward, the cavern walls show multiple levels of the
miniature civilization - cities built into the walls, glowing root networks
connecting settlements, bridges spanning the void, tiny lights from countless
windows, the crack of light above represents the surface world, sense of vast
scale and hidden depth, multiple miniature cities visible at different levels,
bioluminescent plants and crystals line the walls, dramatic vertical composition
rising toward the light, fantasy realism, 9:16 aspect ratio, 8k detail,
awe-inspiring underground world
```

### End Frame (Wide Shot with Wave)

```
Ground level photograph of a cracked concrete sidewalk in daylight, focus on
a prominent crack in the center of frame, at the edge of the crack opening
stands an incredibly tiny humanoid figure barely visible, the figure is waving
upward toward the camera with one arm raised, in the background slightly out
of focus is a large worn boot/shoe frozen mid-step, harsh daylight casting
shadows, the mundane surface world contrasted with the tiny magical figure,
other cracks in the concrete subtly hint at faint inner glow, hyperrealistic
street photography, vertical composition 9:16, the tiny figure is the focal
point despite its small size, 8k photorealistic, leave space in center for
text overlay "They're everywhere. Look closer."
```

## Supplementary Frames (For Better Video Interpolation)

### Transition Frame: Entering the Crack

```
View looking straight down into a dark crack in concrete, the edges of the
crack frame the shot, we are diving downward into darkness, faint warm glow
visible far below suggesting something exists down there, roots and soil
visible on the crack walls, particles of dust floating, sense of rapid descent,
extreme depth, vertical composition 9:16, hyperrealistic, dramatic lighting
from above fading into warm glow below, 8k detail
```

### Detail Frame: Street Level Life

```
Close-up street level view inside the miniature underground city, a tiny
humanoid figure in the foreground carries a large dewdrop balanced on their
shoulder like a water jug, beside them a bioluminescent mushroom serves as a
street lamp casting cyan light, tiny market stalls made from seed pods in the
background, cobblestone-like path made from pebbles, incredible detail in the
miniature architecture, fantasy realism, warm and cool lighting contrast,
vertical composition 9:16, 8k hyperdetailed, miniature world at eye level
```

## Consistency Checklist

Before generating all images, verify:
- [ ] All use 9:16 vertical aspect ratio
- [ ] Bioluminescent colors consistent (cyan/amber/gold)
- [ ] Tiny beings have consistent ambiguous-humanoid design
- [ ] Mushroom architecture style maintained
- [ ] Surface world is muted/realistic, underground is magical/glowing
- [ ] Scale relationship maintained (shoe = massive, beings = tiny)
- [ ] Space left for text overlays in Shot 1 start and Shot 3 end

## Reference Image Strategy

**Recommended approach:**
1. Generate Shot 1 End Frame (city aerial) first - this establishes the world
2. Use that as reference for all underground shots
3. Generate Shot 1 Start Frame (shoe) separately - different style (realistic)
4. Generate Shot 3 End Frame last - bridges both styles
