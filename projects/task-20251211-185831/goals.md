# Project Goals

**Project**: task-20251211-185831
**Created**: 2025-12-11 18:58:31
**Task Type**: Creative Content Production (TikTok Video Prompt Generation)

## Original Request
> Create a super viral TikTok video
> - determine length that is ideal for virality
> - we're going to use an image-to-video model with start and optional end frame
> - up to 10 seconds per shot
> - text-to-image model allows reference images
> - organize output into prompts for image generation and video models

## Research Findings: Optimal Length for Virality

Based on current research (December 2025):

| Length Range | Use Case | Virality Potential |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| **11-18 seconds** | Maximum virality, quick hooks | Highest completion rates, replay loops |
| **21-34 seconds** | Sweet spot per TikTok's team | Best balance of engagement + retention |
| **30-60 seconds** | Narrative content, tutorials | 43% more reach than shorter videos |

**Critical factor**: First 2-3 seconds must hook the viewer. Completion rate heavily influences algorithm.

### Production Constraints
- Image-to-video model: up to 10 seconds per shot
- Need: Start frame (required) + optional end frame
- Text-to-image model: supports reference images for consistency

### Target Length Decision
**21-30 seconds** (3 shots of ~7-10 seconds each)
- Fits the viral sweet spot
- Achievable with 3 image-to-video generations
- Allows for hook → development → payoff structure

## Scope
- **In scope**:
  - Concept development for viral video
  - Storyboard with shot breakdown
  - Image generation prompts (start/end frames)
  - Video generation prompts with motion direction
  - All prompts organized and ready to use

- **Out of scope**:
  - Actually generating the images/videos
  - Audio/music selection (though we'll note suggestions)
  - Posting/distribution strategy

## Success Criteria
1. Compelling concept that matches proven viral formats
2. Strong 2-3 second hook in opening shot
3. Clear visual storytelling across 3 shots
4. Detailed, actionable prompts for image generation
5. Clear motion/action prompts for video generation
6. Consistent visual style across all frames

## Quality Bar
- **Minimum acceptable**: Complete prompt set that could produce a coherent video
- **Target**: Prompts optimized for viral elements (transformation, surprise, emotional hook)
- **Excellent would mean**: Multiple concept options with rationale for why each could go viral

## Model Configuration
- **default_model**: claude
- **verification_model**: claude

## Acceptance Checklist
- [x] Video concept leverages proven viral format — Evidence: concept explanation with research backing
- [x] Optimal length (21-30 seconds) with proper shot breakdown — Evidence: storyboard timing
- [x] Hook in first 2-3 seconds — Evidence: shot 1 description
- [x] Image prompts are detailed and consistent — Evidence: prompt files
- [x] Video prompts include clear motion direction — Evidence: prompt files
- [x] All prompts organized for easy use — Evidence: final deliverable structure
