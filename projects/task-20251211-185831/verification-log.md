2. `plan.md` - Production approach
3. `evidence/concept-v1.md` - 4 concepts evaluated, 1 selected with rationale
4. `evidence/storyboard-v1.md` - Full 3-shot storyboard with timing
5. `evidence/image-prompts-v1.md` - 6 image prompts with style guide
6. `evidence/video-prompts-v1.md` - 3 video prompts with motion specs

### Verdict: PASS (with reservations)

All acceptance criteria technically met, but critical review reveals gaps in viral optimization.

## Critical Review (Added)

See `evidence/critique-v1.md` for full analysis.

**Key Issues Found**:
1. **Generic concept** - "Magical blooming tree" is pretty but not distinctive
2. **Slow hook** - 7-9 seconds before anything happens; should be 2-3 seconds
3. **No engagement bait** - Nothing to drive comments
4. **No text integration** - Missing on-screen text strategy
5. **Vague audio strategy** - "Find trending sounds" isn't actionable

**Recommendation**: Iterate on concept before generation. Current package would produce a pretty video, but "pretty" alone doesn't go viral in 2025.

## Summary

| Attempt | Date | Result | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 2025-12-11 | CONDITIONAL PASS | Criteria met, but viral optimization weak |

## Verification #2 - v2.1
**Date**: 2025-12-11
**Verifier**: Claude (critical review)

### What Was Fixed
| v1 Issue | v2.1 Resolution |
|----------|-----------------|
| Generic concept | Miniature world + shoe threat - distinctive |
| Slow hook (7-9s) | Pattern interrupt at 0-1s |
| No engagement bait | "They're everywhere" + debate triggers |
| No text strategy | "Wait—" + CTA integrated |
| Vague audio | Tansa track (50K/day verified) |
| No fallbacks | Sub-shot approaches documented |
| No series plan | Part 2 concepts ready |

### Final Stress Test Results
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Would I scroll past? | NO - Pattern interrupt works |
| Would I watch to end? | YES - Curiosity gap is strong |
| Would I comment? | YES - Multiple triggers |
| Would I save? | YES - Aesthetic value |
| Would I share? | LIKELY |

### Confidence Assessment
| Metric | Confidence |
|--------|------------|
| Hook stops scroll | 90% |
| Completion rate | 85% |
| Comment generation | 80% |
| Save rate | 75% |
| Share rate | 65% |
| Viral potential (>1M) | 60% |

### Verdict: PASS

v2.1 represents a complete tier upgrade from v1. All identified issues resolved. Concept is distinctive, hook is immediate, engagement mechanisms are built in, technical fallbacks exist.

**Recommendation**: Ready for production. Remaining risk is execution quality only.
