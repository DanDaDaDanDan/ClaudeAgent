## Critical Review (Added)

See `evidence/critique-v1.md` for full analysis.

**Key Issues Found**:
1. **Generic concept** - "Magical blooming tree" is pretty but not distinctive
2. **Slow hook** - 7-9 seconds before anything happens; should be 2-3 seconds
3. **No engagement bait** - Nothing to drive comments
4. **No text integration** - Missing on-screen text strategy
5. **Vague audio strategy** - "Find trending sounds" isn't actionable

**Recommendation**: Iterate on concept before generation. Current package would produce a pretty video, but "pretty" alone doesn't go viral in 2025.
