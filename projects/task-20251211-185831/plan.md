# Plan

**Task**: Create viral TikTok video prompts (image + video generation)
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Approach

Create a complete prompt package for a viral TikTok video using:
1. Text-to-image model for keyframes (start + optional end frames)
2. Image-to-video model for animation (up to 10 sec per shot)
3. Target: 21-30 seconds total (3 shots)

## Phases

### Phase 1: Concept Selection
Select a viral-worthy concept from proven formats:
- **Transformation** (before/after, glow-up)
- **Satisfying/Oddly Satisfying** (completion, restoration)
- **POV** (immersive first-person scenario)
- **Unexpected Twist** (setup → subversion)
- **Wholesome/Emotional** (hopecore, heartwarming)

### Phase 2: Storyboard Design
- Shot 1 (0-10s): THE HOOK - must grab attention in first 2-3 seconds
- Shot 2 (10-20s): THE BUILD - develop tension/interest
- Shot 3 (20-30s): THE PAYOFF - satisfying conclusion/twist

### Phase 3: Image Prompt Generation
For each shot, create:
- Start frame prompt (required)
- End frame prompt (optional, for guided motion)
- Style consistency notes
- Reference image suggestions

### Phase 4: Video Prompt Generation
For each shot, specify:
- Motion type and direction
- Camera movement (if any)
- Timing/pacing notes
- Transition to next shot

### Phase 5: Final Assembly
- Compile all prompts into organized deliverable
- Add audio/music suggestions
- Include posting best practices

## Checkpoints
- After concept selection: Does this have viral potential?
- After storyboard: Is the hook strong enough?
- After prompts: Are they detailed enough for generation?
